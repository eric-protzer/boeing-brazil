# Boeing Brazil - Bibliographic Discovery Tool

This tool can be used to search the SciELO on-line scientific library. SciELO is an open access electronic database containing open-access technical publications. It was established in Brazil in 1997, and now covers 14 countries, mostly in Latin America (see http://www.scielo.org). 

This tool covers Brazilian publications only.  It searchers for occurrences of user-defined search term(s) in titles and abstracts, and returns each paper’s title, abstract, author(s), affiliation(s), and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which can be used to find the original paper.

There are several reasons to use this script instead of SciELO’s online search tool:

1) It searches in English and Portuguese at the same time.

2) It covers Brazilian technical research exclusively.  Non-technical publications and papers from other countries are not included. 

3) It shows results that contain both specified search terms and related research topics.

4) It shows papers grouped into thematic 'clusters' which pertain to specific research topics, which may make it easier to navigate exact research themes.
