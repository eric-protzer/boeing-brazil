## Instructions:
Click the following icon to launch the interactive Jupyter Notebook server. Once launched, please wait for the server to load. 

After it has finished loading you should see a screen listing files from this repository. Click on "Keyword Search.ipynb" to open the file used to search through the network. It will contain further instructions.

If something seems broken you can ensure that the server is running properly with the "test.ipynb" file. It will run a simple "Hello World" function.
