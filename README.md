# Boeing Brazil - Bibliographic Discovery Tool

This tool can be used to search the SciELO on-line scientific library. SciELO is an open access electronic database that covers open-access publications. It was established in Brazil in 1997, but now covers 14 countries, mostly in Latin America (see http://www.scielo.org). This tool covers Brazilian publications only, and will yield information on papers related to your specific search term (i.e. title, abstract, authors, affiliations, and a DOI code which can be used to find the original paper). 

There are several reasons you may want to use this script instead of using SciELOâ€™s online search tool:

1) It searches in English and Portuguese at the same time.

2) It covers Brazilian technical research exclusively, with no non-technical publications nor papers from other countries. 

3) It show results that both contain your specified keywords and keywords related to your search term.

4) It shows papers grouped into thematic 'clusters' which pertain to specific research topics , which may make it easier to navigate exact research themes.
